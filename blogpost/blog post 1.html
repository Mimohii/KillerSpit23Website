      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:300px;"><img class="maintenancekotori" src="../resources/img/myuzu.jpg" style: width="500px;"></div>
      <p>because i can't make a website that can host forever, i decided to add some ads for this in order to work on improving the website, the site will be regularly updated as soon as there will be some new contents will be available <br> 
        Making a website just like this (the design is still look weird but soon i'll design it), in order to make the website<br>
        functioning properly, it needs to be maintain by the server running all the time, therefor the third party server<br>
      is not free, it is maintained by the first user and who got the invitational invitation on the drive, make sure you support us by donating
      <br>at any of these 
      <br>Paypal: aquorsforever23@gmail.com
      <br>if you can't donate there, you can still support this site by sharing the website to your friend</p>
